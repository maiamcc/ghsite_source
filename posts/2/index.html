  <div class="entry-content"><p>In response to a recent Hacker School discussion about fluffy book recommendations written by !(white &amp; cis-male), here&rsquo;s a list of some of my go-to&rsquo;s, and books I&rsquo;ve enjoyed reading lately. What defines fluff? That&rsquo;s a more complicated question for a later time. How I&rsquo;ve been thinking of it lately is as books that don&rsquo;t require much effort to read/parse&ndash;i.e., not an awful lot of subtext, relatively simple language nad not too much artistry of the obfuscating variety in the text itself&ndash;that play off characters and tropes that we like to read about. They will generally have not-terribly-well-developed characters, characters that are easy to identify with, and the stories and happy endings that we want for ourselves. But, regardless of my definitional musings, here are some books! And so, in no particular order:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Annie on My Mind</em> by Nancy Garden: LOVE. I think it was the first bit of lesbian lit that I read, and thus holds a special place in my heart.</li>
<li><em>The Miseducation of Cameron Post</em>, by Emily M. Danforth: follows a young girl&rsquo;s sexual self-discovery, first love(s), and her time at a homosexual rehabilitation program.</li>
<li><em>Beautiful Game</em> and <em>Solstice</em> by Kate Christie: fluff in the highest degree, but well-written, engaging, hold-your-attention-till-the-very-end fluff. (I also think it&rsquo;s worth noting that I typed the title to the first as &ldquo;Beautiful Gayme&rdquo; the first time through. Oops&hellip;)</li>
<li>Anything by Tamora Pierce, but especially the <em>Song of the Lioness</em> quartet: because Tamora Pierce is the bomb, and has an incredible gift for plots, and has been the beginning of more girls&#8217; feminism than can be counted. Feminist, sex-positive, swords-and-sorcery high fantasy at its best!</li>
<li>The <em>Young Wizards</em> books by Diane Duane: no queers, but excellent fantasy. A complex world of wizardy set against the backdrop of a modern-day Long Island suburb and the general difficulties of middle- and high-school.</li>
<li><em>The Miles Vorkosigan Saga</em> by Lois McMaster Bujold: a departure from the rest of this list. Not about queer people, but rather a sci-fi intrigue-and-space-battles series in which the protagonist is the physically deformed Miles. Without very much physical power at all, Miles has to rely on his wits, and what wits he has. He accidentally assembles a mercenary space fleet&ndash;oops! And that&rsquo;s just the beginning&hellip; (The first book in the series is <em>The Warrior&rsquo;s Apprentice</em>.)</li>
<li><em>Graceling</em> (and <em>Fire</em> and <em>Bitterblue</em>) by Kristin Cashore: more excellent YA high fantasy with kick-ass female protagonists, well-rounded characters, gripping plotlines, and excellent super-powers. Did I mention it was written by a Williams alum?</li>
<li><em>A Love Story Starring My Dead Best Friend</em> by Emily Horner: I&rsquo;m going to go ahead and guess that Horner was a thespian in high school, because her descriptions of the thespian community in this book are almost frustratingly specific in the sort of in-jokes and quirkiness that they entail, but because of that, quite true to life. Our narrator Cass tries to come to grips with the death of her best friend Julia, and the feelings she (Cass) may have had for her, as she works tireless to realize Julia&rsquo;s secret project, the musical &ldquo;Totally Sweet Ninja Death Squad&rdquo;, with some complicated (of course, because why would it ever not be complicated?) romance thrown in for good measure.</li>
<li><em>If You Follow Me</em> by Malena Watrous: two American women (lovers) living in Japan teaching English and navigating their life together and all that it entails.</li>
<li><em>The Age of Miracles</em> by Karen Thompson Walker: picked this up on a whim from a street-side used book stand and was pleasntly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. The rotation of the earth is slowly slowing. As days and nights get longer and the very fabric of human life is thrown into disarray, Julia narrates a gut-punching blend of apocolypse and the trials and tribulations of middle-school.</li>
</ul>


<p>(Also, they don&rsquo;t belong on this list officially because, y&#8217;know, cis white dudes, but stuff by David Levithan and David Sedaris is highly enjoyable&ndash;the first writes adorable and heartwarming gay-boy romances, the second writes gloriously dorky comedic autobiographical essays.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At Hacker School today, I didn&rsquo;t get all that much done, and in my day&rsquo;s worth of non-progress I brushed up against two distinct kinds of &ldquo;wasted&rdquo; time.</p>

<p>The first is somewhat productive, as wasted time goes. I spent most of the afternoon barking up various wrong trees as I tried to figure out how to structure the next step of my current project (a contradance database, which I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll blog about for real soon). Kind of like a real-life breadth-first search where every node takes several hours.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve got a way to structure my data, and now I want to be able to search and sort and filter a bunch of these data-bundles. First I assumed I&rsquo;d write the search code in Python and worry about making it web-app-y later. I started brainstorming and had <em>no idea</em> how I would optimize my code, and then someone suggested I use <a href="datatables.net">Data Tables</a> a JQuery plug-in which will search and sort data super fast. So I spent a while reading up on Data Tables, looking through FAQs and add-ons and trying to figure out if it would give me some of the more advanced searching functionality I wanted. Someone else then suggested that if I ultimately wanted to search by a giant table of data invisible to the user, why don&rsquo;t I just use mySQL and go right to the database end of things? So I talked to Andrew and hashed out a vague plan and set up mySQL on my machine and found some nice-looking tutorials&hellip; only to have someone <em>else</em> point out that hey, you don&rsquo;t need to worry about learning SQL, <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a> can do all of that for you and you still get to write in Python. I gave Django a quick look, got excited, and then whoops it was 5:00.</p>

<p>So, frustratingly, I ended this saga with not a jot of code written, not a step of a tutorial progressed through. Not a pleasant feeling. But I console myself with the thought that my day was still <em>somewhat</em> productive, by some metrics. Unlike when I started, I know what I&rsquo;m doing next. Unlike when I started, I know a bit more about Data Tables (which I think I <em>will</em> end up using for the front end of my final product) and mySQL (which is a good thing for anyone working with databases to understand). And so even if I&rsquo;m right back at point A, I can move forward from here. I might call this sort of time-wasting <em>productive time-wasting</em>, or maybe <em>foundational time-wasting</em>, since, though it doesn&rsquo;t accomplish anything itself, it lays a foundation for future accomplishment of things.</p>

<p>The second kind of time I wasted is harder to feel good about. It was <em>unproductive time-wasting</em> at its finest. I didn&rsquo;t even get a shaved yak out of it. By the time I gave up on the above because my brain was fried, I decided that I would spend an hour trying to get some dynamic content on my website and then head home around 6 (because I know that I don&rsquo;t do good work that late into the evening&ndash;better for me to leave earlier and <em>actually</em> not work, as opposed to pretending to work but accomplishing nothing).</p>

<p>I spent the next hour and a half poking around AJAX and history.js tutorials, still no closer to what I wanted. It&rsquo;s easy enough to make a link-click change the content of a div with AJAX, but what I really want is for the page URL to change as well, but without reloading the page (unless the user has a crappy browser that doesn&rsquo;t support AJAX), and for the page change to be accessible as history, foward- or back-able, etc. I figured out how to change a div with AJAX within the first 15 minutes, and the rest of that time was spent banging my head against history.js READMEs and tutorials and stack overflow topics.</p>

<p>Unlike that first chunk of wasted time, at the end of my dynamic content spree I felt no more knowledgeable than when I began, no better equipped to tackle the problem. All I felt was inadequate and imposter-y because I couldn&rsquo;t decipher any of the history.js walkthroughs or code examples.</p>

<p>So, lessons learned from all this: I want to start setting myself discrete chunks of time in which to do things. Not only will this make it easier to start on daunting projects[1] and give my workflow more structure so that I&rsquo;m not jumping around all the time, it will (hopefully) keep me back from the edge of the black hole. After I&rsquo;ve spent an hour (especially late in the evening) on something like the dynamic content thing and a timer goes off on my computer, I have to step back and reevaluate. &ldquo;Am I getting stuff done? Is it time to ask for help? Is my brain too mushy to keep doing this? Is my current approach still working?&rdquo; Even if I do the same task for several hours straight, setting myself a little mental check-in every hour or every 45 minutes will, I hope, help keep me on track. Plus, I do much better with accountability when I have a concrete timeline. Yesterday I resolved that before lunch I would write a README for my <a href="https://github.com/maianess/markovgen">abandoned Markov generator</a> so that I could come back to it later, and I&rsquo;d go through a chapter of the <a href="http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html">Interactive Python Algorithms and Data Structures</a> course. I did both of those things, and I felt <em>so good</em> about doing all the things that I&rsquo;d said I was going to do!</p>

<p>Also, I&rsquo;m curious how I will react to having more, smaller projects that I can work on in fits and starts, without oversaturating my brain with any one thing. I&rsquo;m thinking of giving this a try&ndash;maybe some of the coding exercises in the Interactive Python tutorial, maybe <a href="http://mathamy.com/pages/phonebook.html">Amy Hanlon&rsquo;s phonebook exercise</a>, or one of the mini-projects from the old HS <a href="https://hackpad.com/Iron-Forger-kEmauANGcV5">Ironforger</a> group. Something to put on the back-burners of my brain!</p>

<p>[1] For instance, after I finish this post, I&rsquo;m gonna go spend 30 minutes working on the actual content of my website, which is something I&rsquo;ve been putting of for <em>forever</em>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had this grand, exciting plan. A normal Markov generator trians on a corpus of text, and sees what words are likely to come after other words. So for example, given &ldquo;Happy families are all alike,&rdquo; it would say, &ldquo;Happy families&rdquo; &ndash;> &ldquo;are&rdquo;, &ldquo;families are&rdquo; &ndash;> &ldquo;all&rdquo;, &ldquo;are all&rdquo; &ndash;> &ldquo;alike&rdquo;. You can then start with any random seed and populate a whole chunk of however much text you please by going through your correspondance and picking at random: &ldquo;hmm, what words might possibly come after &lsquo;are all&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was going to take it one step further and incorporate part-of-speech tagging. The above example sentence would be part-of-speech tagged, &ldquo;adjective/plural noun/verb non-3rd person singular present/determiner/adverb.&rdquo; Then I could make a correspondance: adjective + plural noun may be followed by a non-3rd person singular present verb, and so on. And when I had a whole paragraph or two worth of &ldquo;adjective noun verb&rdquo; etc. I could begin to fill that in from my word correspondance: &ldquo;What word might come after &lsquo;families are&rsquo; that is also a noun?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was brilliant! I was excited! And, as you&rsquo;ve probably guessed, things didn&rsquo;t turn out the way I had planned. I didn&rsquo;t quite consider that one of my correspondances was much more general than the other, so is I generated my parts-of-speech beforehand and then went looking for a word that can follow words a + b and is also a (fill in part of speech here), I wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily find anything! And then I&rsquo;m reduced to filling in a random (part of speech), which leaves me no better off than a normal Markov generator, and perhaps even worse (see my last two posts for comparison).</p>

<p>So, my whole project idea is a bit shot in the foot. There&rsquo;s one more thing I can try, which is generating the parts-of-speech and actual-words versions of my text pretty much concurrently. Given Word A and Word B, what&rsquo;s a part-of-speech that might follow part-of-speech(Word A) and part-of-speech(Word B)? Now, what&rsquo;s a word that might follow Word A and Word B that is a (part of speech)? And, y&#8217;know, even as I type this I&rsquo;m not positive that it makes any sense whatsoever, and will be any better than a standard-issue Markov generator. (I&rsquo;ll need to think this through more carefully when I haven&rsquo;t had a beer.)</p>

<p>This whole debacle raises the question: when is it time to give up? When do I dump this project and say, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been fun, but that thing I wanted to do is no longer feasible, I&rsquo;m going to move on to something else&rdquo;? If my grand plan has been foiled, do I leave the project altogether? Do I struggle to implement some halfway excecution of my original plan that doesn&rsquo;t quite make sense? Do I do something else vaguely useful with the project, but in another direction entirely? I&rsquo;m a little curious to, say, look at n-grams of increasing n&rsquo;s&ndash;that is, look at bigger and bigger groups of words at a time&ndash;and see where the trade-off is between intelligibility and just reproducing the original text. Another interesting path to take would be implementing a custom data structure that could weight common words, rather than having the word in question show up multiple times for a given key according to its frequency. But none of that is the stuff I came into this project excited about doing.</p>

<p>Was this all a waste of time? No, I don&rsquo;t think so. I learned about serializers and thought a bit about program optimization for the first time (even though I figured out that all that was bloating my run-time was <a href="www.nltk.org">nltk</a>&rsquo;s incredible but super-slow part-of-speech tagger). I got yet more practice writing in Python, made my own classes, played in REPLs, made my first generator function, and learned the hard way that new instances of objects, even if they seem identical to other instances of that same object, are NOT IN FACT IDENTICAL. (I may or may not have spent my entire morning learning that one.) Plus, I learned how smoothly things can run if you map out your program beforehand (and, conversely, how borked they can get if you don&rsquo;t).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still a little bummed that I won&rsquo;t have something shiny to show for this at the end. Well, I&rsquo;ll have my simple Markov gen, but nothing all that original, and I&rsquo;ve sunk a week on this project. But ennumerating the things I&rsquo;ve actually learned from this hot mess of a project has persuaded me somewhat, so I feel a little better. (Plus, a Markov generator is a still <a href="https://twitter.com/WhalePrejudice">a pretty damn good party trick</a>!)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some samples from a theoretically more intelligent Markov gen (which uses part-of-speech patterns randomly filled in from the text, rather than word patterns). Though honestly, this one seems a fair bit worse than the &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; one. I&rsquo;ll try phase two, which will combine the two approaches: filling in a part-of-speech skeleton using word patterns collected from the text. Anyway, here&rsquo;s some gobbledygook!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At the end of Week 2, I&rsquo;m still overwhelmed, but a bit less, and with a bit more conviction that I can in fact write code. I finished my first project in Python yesterday, and spent this morning implementing some code review I got. Here are some things I learned, mainly for my own reference but perhaps other beginning Python folks will find it useful as well:</p>

<ul>
<li>4x spaces instead of tabs (Sublime will do this for you really easily! Sublime is magic!)</li>
<li>instead of a million &ldquo;or&rsquo;s&rdquo; in some truth statement, ask if it&rsquo;s in a list instead. So for instance, instead of <code>if a == 1 or a == True or a == true</code>, use <code>if a in [1, "True", "true"]</code>.</li>
<li>next time I write a program that makes the user pick among options from the command line (dear God, hopefully never again), instead of a giant string of if/elif&rsquo;s, consider a dictionary that maps user responses to the functions they excecute.</li>
<li>if I did this again, I&rsquo;d have made better use of classes, both as a) a way to group related methods and b) a way to keep track of the objects I was modifying. (Had a hell of a time trying to change some global variable, only to find that I&rsquo;d somehow modified it as a local variable instead. Calling a method ON that object would eliminate that problem.)</li>
<li>modular code is useful. Next time.</li>
<li>you can do way more in <code>return</code> statements than I ever thought you could (like funky if statements and for loops).</li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;ve figured out my next project! I&rsquo;ll be doing fun stuff with the English language (always a hoot) and <a href="http://setosa.io/blog/2014/07/26/markov-chains/">Markov Chains</a>. More specifically, I&rsquo;m gonna write a program that will generate moderately-intelligible English text, based on patterns it leanrs from a sample text that I feed it. I&rsquo;ll start simple (just learning patterns of the words themselves), and if that works, I&rsquo;ll build a more complicated version (that recognizes syntactical patterns as well). Maybe if I have great success, I&rsquo;ll be able to do something whacky like a haiku generator!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m baaaack! Miss me? Well, if you didn&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s okay, because I&rsquo;m not even sure who you are or why you&rsquo;re reading this. But if you are reading this and you did miss me, well, then, great!</p>

<p>Nearing the end of week 2 of Hacker School. I really did mean to blog much more regularly, but then I installed Mavericks (unintentionally locking myself out of my computer for an hour) and it borked my Octopress/Ruby set-up, and then I didn&rsquo;t manage to get it all working again until just now.</p>

<p>ANYWAY. So I wrote a thing in Python! I made a <a href="github.com/maianess/studentchooser">Student Chooser</a> that runs out of command line and will pick  a student at random from a given roster of students, with decreasing likelihood according to how many times that student has been picked already. It also lets you keep track of who is absent and move between multiple rosters (i.e. multiple classes). It&rsquo;s dorktastic and clocks in at 500 lines, and I can&rsquo;t tell if that&rsquo;s because it actually needed to be 500 lines long or because it&rsquo;s inefficient coding. But it&rsquo;s done, and it&rsquo;s my first completed piece of code in Python, and it was super enlightening to write! Really got the basics of Python (syntax, loops, some of the common list/string/dict. operators, etc.) under my fingers, plus some reading/writing file stuff.</p>

<p>I think I did a halfway decent job of staying on task, but I definitely got distracted from Big Thing I Was Trying to Implement by Ooh, Shiny Little Thing. I had some to-do lists along the way, but none of them were ordered (by priority or otherwise), and I think that might be a good thing to keep in mind for my next project. Also, having these by <em>physical, paper lists</em>, I imagine, would be a lot more helpful and a lot more satisfying than having them in Evernote. Also, I ought to remember how helpful I find it to write out confusing bits of code longhand, and to chart the flow of a program with pen and paper. Cuz apparently I&rsquo;m some sort of visual learner&ndash;thanks, <a href="http://melchua.com/">Mel Chua</a>! (Mel Chua is a super excellent programmer and educator who gave a <a href="http://blog.melchua.com/2013/06/19/hacker-school-session-engineering-learning-styles/">talk on learning styles</a> last week. Fascinating and useful stuff.)</p>

<p>(Remember when I was working my way through <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/">Learn Python the Hard Way</a>? Yeah, I stopped. Turns out I REALLY don&rsquo;t like this guy&rsquo;s writing style. So I decided to just write some code. Which I did. And which was super helpful! (Maybe I&rsquo;m an active learner? See above&hellip;))</p>

<p>Other stuff: am now participating in a weekly algorithms group, which I&rsquo;m very happy about. It&rsquo;s helping offset the &ldquo;Oh my god, I know nothing, I&rsquo;m so inadequate&rdquo; panic of being one of the less experienced programmers of a batch of Hacker Schoolers, because now I feel like I&rsquo;m being proactive and doing something about the stuff I don&rsquo;t know, rather than sitting there panicking about how much I don&rsquo;t know. (Which is tricky business, because I don&rsquo;t even know enough to know what I want to learn, so I just sit there and panic. Useful, huh?)</p>

<p><em>Upcoming</em>: I&rsquo;m thinking of something involving Markov chains to teach a program basic language syntax and generate text. If I&rsquo;m feeling cute, I might make it into a haiku gen. This is a stepping stone towards a possible choral harmonizer, which in its fully complete form will probably use Markov chains to determind the probability of various chords following one another, and maybe also towards a contradance generator, which will do something similar with contradance moves. Also, I&rsquo;ve been encouraged to use more custom Classes in the next thing I write, and give a little more thought to how I use functions to capitalize on that&ndash;e.g., I don&rsquo;t need to worry about when variables are global vs. local and oh my gosh am I changing the right variable if I call a method that&rsquo;s _attached to the thing I want to change__. Handy.</p>

<p>Also, I&rsquo;m gonna read through bits of that big purple Python book and see what I don&rsquo;t know and go find out more about that, and maybe dip my toes into the <a href="http://interactivepython.org/">Interactive Python</a> tutorials.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all for now! Hopefully actual, somewhat regular blogging will commence soon, stay tuned!</p>
