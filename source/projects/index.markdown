I tend not to code an awful lot outside of work, because in my free time I recharge best away from a computer screen, and I've got more than enough interetsing coding problems to tackle in the office. Still, sometimes I do stuff. On this page you'll find a handful of projects I've been hacking on recently, _or_ projects I did in the past that I deem fit for human consumption, _or_ projects I worked on wayyy back that are just entertaining. For a more complete picture of my extracurricular coding, go poke around on [my Github](//github.com/maiamcc).

<div class="project">
    <p>
        <h3><a href="//github.com/maiamcc/xkcd_binge" target="_blank">XKCD Binge</a></h3><h4>(Javascript)</h4>
    </p>
        <strong>What</strong>: a <a href="//chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xkcd-binge/pnhnbhcdjnblacgalelbbnkpkkffchgb?hl=en-US&gl=US" target="_blank">Chrome extension</a> to make browsing XKCD easier -- I wanted to reread XKCD from the beginning, so I threw together an extension to enable me to do all of my browsing from my keyboard.
    <p>
        <strong>When</strong>: May 2017
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Status</strong>: published to the <a href="//chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xkcd-binge/pnhnbhcdjnblacgalelbbnkpkkffchgb?hl=en-US&gl=US" target="_blank">Chrome Web Store</a>
    </p>
</div>

<div class="project">
    <p>
        <h3><a href="//github.com/RagtagOpen/nomad" target="_blank">Project Nomad</a></h3><h4>(Python, Flask)</h4>
    </p>
        <strong>What</strong>: I contributed to <a href="//ragtag.org/nomad/">Project Nomad</a>, a web app developed by <a href="//ragtag.org">Ragtag</a> to help canvassing volunteers organize carpools to areas where their work can have the greatest impact.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>When</strong>: Summer/Fall 2017 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Status</strong>: finished and available for use by candidates! 
    </p>
</div>

<div class="project">
    <p>
        <h3><a href="//github.com/maiamcc/not-my-locker-room/tree/generalizedContentScript" target="_blank">Not My Locker Room</a></h3><h4>(Python)</h4>
    </p>
        <strong>What</strong>: I wrote tooling to help maintain the <a href="//notmylockerroom.com" target="_blank">Not My Locker Room</a> website, built and run by <a href="https://devprogress.us" target="_blank">DevProgress</a>. In particular, I wrote template-filling script to take content elements from a csv, hit the appropriate API to get oEmbed code, and insert into an html template.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>When</strong>: November 2016
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Status</strong>: my code was in use generating the website before we stopped maintaining it. I may someday generalize this code for wider use.
    </p>

<div class="project">
    <p>
        <h3><a href="//github.com/maiamcc/thumbnailer" target="-_blank">Thumbnailer</a></h3><h4>(Python, using <a href="//pillow.readthedocs.io/en/4.1.x/" target="-_blank">Pillow</a>)</h4>
    </p>
        <strong>What</strong>: utility to make thumbnails of your images. I was working on a freelance web dev project and needed thumbnails of all of the images, so instead of spending 30 minutes in PhotoShop, I spent three hours writing this. Time well spent? 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>When</strong>: March 2015
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Status</strong>: complete (though who knows when I'll ever have occasion to use it again...)
    </p>
</div>

<div class="project">
    <p>
        <h3><a href="//github.com/maiamcc/gravity" target="_blank">Gravity</a> (<a href="/projects/gravity/play.html">play it!</a>)</h3><h4>(Javascript, <a href="//codeheartjs.com" target="_blank">codeheart.js</a>)</h4>
    </p>
        <strong>What</strong>: a gravity-bending platformer exhibiting the finest of programmer art, written for the 2014 Williams College Game Jam. Want to know more? <a href="/projects/gravity/play.html">Play it here</a>!
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>When</strong>: January 2014
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Status</strong>: complete
    </p>
</div>

<div class="project">
    <p>
        <h3><a href="//github.com/maiamcc/punbot" target="_blank">Punbot</a></h3><h4>(Python, NLTK, Zulip API)</h4>
    </p>
        <strong>What</strong>: a <a href="https://zulip.org" target="_blank">Zulip</a> bot that lurks until presented with an opportunity to make a quote-unquote "pun" of the form: "Parse 'er? I hardly know 'er!"
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>When</strong>: Fall 2014 (Recurse Center)
    <p>
        <strong>Status</strong>: complete, launched on Heroku, and promptly retired, as (much to my surprise!) it turns out that "[blank] 'er? I hardly know 'er!" is only funny for so long.
    </p>
