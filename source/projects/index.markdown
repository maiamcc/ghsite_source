This page is woefully out of date; I'm busy with exciting problems at work and exciting things in life, and if I've got spare time for coding I want to be hacking on stuff, not writing descriptions of the stuff I'm hacking on. So until I get a chance to overhaul this properly, this page will remain basically an archive of the stuff I worked on at [the Recurse Center](//www.recurse.com/). If you're curious about what I've been up to more recently, go poke around on [my Github](//github.com/maiamcc). Enjoy!

        <h3><a href="//github.com/maiamcc/contradb">ContraDB</a></h3><h4>(Python, JQuery, Django)</h4>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>What</strong>: a searchable Django database of folk dance choreographies.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>When</strong>: Summer 2014 (Hacker School) --> ongoing
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Why</strong>: contra is one of my big interests outside the hacking world. I’m a dancer, <a href="http://contra.maiamccormick.com/">caller</a> (i.e. dance leader), and dance writer, and I’ve always wanted a big, comprehensive database of dances so that I could go looking specifically for [dances that have weird but cool move sequence X-Y-Z] or [dances that end with move A], etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Status</strong>: very much a work in progress. Some day it will be operational (and pretty, too)! Some day!

        <h3><a href="//github.com/maiamcc/gravity">Gravity</a></h3><h4>(Javascript, <a href="//codeheartjs.com">codeheart.js</a>)</h4>
    </p>
        <strong>What</strong>: a gravity-bending platformer exhibiting the finest of programmer art. Want to know more? <a href="/projects/gravity/play.html">Play it here</a>!
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>When</strong>: January 2014
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Why</strong>: Williams College Game Jam '14
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Status</strong>: shiny and done!
    </p>

<div class="project">
    <p>
        <h3><a href="//github.com/maiamcc/goob">Goob</a></h3><h4>(Python)</h4>
    </p>
        <strong>What</strong>: a version control system, more or less an imitation git.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>When</strong>: Fall 2014 (Hacker School)
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Why</strong>: to get experience writing (and perhaps more importantly, organizing) a more complicated program with more moving parts; as a test to see just how well I understood the inner workings of git; more practice writing tests.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Status</strong>: tabled for now. This is not the final product, but I’ve gotten plenty out of this project, enough that I feel good about moving on for now and coming back to it sometime later whenever I get inspired to.
    </p>

<div class="project">
    <p>
        <h3><a href="//github.com/maiamcc/markovgen">Markov Generator(s)</a></h3><h4>(Python, NLTK)</h4>
    </p>
        <strong>What</strong>: a) a Markov chain text generator that generates pseudo-random text in the style of a given corpus, and b) a part-of-speech-based Markov generator that attempts to combine a basic Markov generator with part-of-speech constraints.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>When</strong>: Summer 2014 (Hacker School)
    <p>
        <strong>Why</strong>: do a cool project to learn some more Python! Maybe learn things that can be applied to future cool projects (haiku generator, anyone?).
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Status</strong>: both the regular and POS Markov generators are finished and operational, and both generate texts somewhere on a continuum of `total nonsense --> vaguely syntactical gibberish --> the text repeated verbatim`. POS Markov gen was notably less successful than I had hoped.
    </p>

        <h3><a href="//github.com/maiamcc/phonebook">Phonebook</a></h3><h4>(Python)</h4>
    </p>
        <strong>What</strong>: a command-line app that manages phonebooks.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>When</strong>: August 2014 (Hacker School)
    <p>
        <strong>Why</strong>: bite-sized coding exercise: I wanted to pick a smallish, self-contained task, sit down for a few hours, and turn out a functional finished product.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Status</strong>: it works! Not that anyone will ever use it to keep track of their phone numbers, but it works!
    </p>
</div>

<div class="project">
    <p>
        <h3><a href="//github.com/maiamcc/punbot">Punbot</a></h3><h4>(Python, NLTK, Zulip API)</h4>
    </p>
        <strong>What</strong>: a bot for Zulip (Hacker School’s internal chat program) that lurks until presented with an opportunity to make a quote-unquote "pun" of the form, "Parse 'er? I hardly know 'er!"
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>When</strong>: Fall 2014 (Hacker School)
    <p>
        <strong>Why</strong>: because PUNS! Also, I wanted to get practice working with someone else's API.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Status</strong>: shiny, done, launched on Heroku, and promptly retired, as (much to my surprise!) it turns out that "[blank] 'er? I hardly know 'er!" is only funny for so long.
    </p>

<div class="project">
    <p>
        <h3><a href="//github.com/maiamcc/studentchooser">Student Chooser</a></h3><h4>(Python)</h4>
    </p>
        <strong>What</strong>: a command-line app for teachers that almost-randomly picks a student from a given roster. Supports multiple classes and absence-tracking.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>When</strong>: July 2014 (Hacker School)
    <p>
        <strong>Why</strong>: to teach myself Python!
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Status</strong>: as done as it's going to get. Not the most functional, but it does what it's supposed to do (and was more a coding exercise than a tool for use, anyway). Recently refactored (without changing functionality) just to see what the difference would be.

    </p>

    <p>
        <h3><a href="//github.com/maiamcc/sudoku">Sudoku Solver</a></h3><h4>(Python)</h4>
    </p>
        <strong>What</strong>: a sudoku solver; takes a board (as a big long string), solves it, and prints the solved board to terminal.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>When</strong>: September 2014 (Hacker School)
    <p>
        <strong>Why</strong>: as an exercise in pair programming (written with <a href="//github.com/mlauter">Miriam Lauter</a>) and in writing tests/TDD.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Status</strong>: solves <em>most</em> sudoku boards, but not nondeterministic ones (i.e. boards where you can’t find one unique solution just from narrowing down the options of each square until one remains).
