How to do interview prep during your full time job
[preamble goes here]
[senior level]  

### Don't panic
No seriously, don't panic. It's gonna be okay. You're gonna start slowly and work your way up to interviews, you're gonna be smart about scheduling interviews to minimize disruption of your day job, and you are hireable and desirable and don't let that little jerk voice in your head tell you otherwise.

### Set secrecy levels to... eh, something
If your current employer suspects that you're interviewing, it's not the worst thing! (There are of course some toxic workplaces that are the exception to this rule.) Everyone does it---it's part of the tech job circle of life. Don't go shouting it from the rooftops, and try to be discrete, but also don't worry too hard about whether you're being conspicuous. A. you're probably being a lot less obvious than you think (your co-workers/bosses aren't actually scrutinizing you that closely), but also B. if someone suspects that you're looking, whatever.

Remember that you don't need to explain your "busy" calendar blocks to anyone. Get in the habit early of not offering explanations---instead of "Out of Office (dentist)", just mark "Out of Office".

Don't tell your boss(es) before you're ready to give notice, but you can absolutely tell one or two trusted coworkers that you’re looking (this can be great moral support). Consider who you will ask for a reference, and consider letting them know that you're looking a little in advance of actually asking for the reference.

### Minimizing work disruptions
Job hunting while working a job is tricky but absolutely doable. There will be some disruption to your day job, but with careful planning and good bookkeeping, you can minimize both that disruption, and the stress and guilt that sometimes comes with it. (Remember, you don't actually want to leave your current workplace in the lurch!)

Step 1 is to accept that you won't be doing your day job at full capacity while interviewing. That's okay. Set expectations at work: keep people updated on your project timelines as they inevitably fall a little behind, and don't bite off more work than you can chew. Ideally, you can make an excuse of the form "I've got some personal stuff going on right now so I'll be working a little under capacity." That's it, that's all they need to know. Resist the instinct to give more details or make more excuses---everyone has lives.

This may be a no-brainer, but make sure that any interviews etc. are marked as "busy" on your work calendar---you don't want people trying to schedule meetings that you then have to decline. I heartily recommend using [Calendly](https://calendly.com/) for scheduling. Spring for the pro plan for a month or two, and you can send individual meeting-booking links to all of the recruiters etc. you're working with, while being sure that nothing scheduled will interfere with anything on your work calendar.

To minimize disruption to your workday, take calls/interviews at the beginning or end of your workday if you can (or during your lunch hour). That said, respect your body's rhythms. If you're foggy in the mornings or if you start to flag in the afternoons, don't schedule technical interviews then.

### Interview Prep

#### Timeline
If like me, you're *super intimidated* by the prospect of job hunting, remember that you're allowed to start slow. You don't need to be 100% sure you want to leave or completely ready to schedule your interviews to start doing practice problems or to update your resume.

Something that worked well for me: as soon as I realized I would be looking for a new job, I put a recurring weekly 1 hour block of "interview prep" time on my calendar. It helped me make a little progress each week, without freaking out at all times about whether I "should" be prepping.

#### What to Prep
* **Resume** --- update your resume with all the cool stuff you've been doing lately. Write down all of the interesting projects you've done at this job; you'll only end up putting a few on your resume, but having a list of things you've worked on lately will be helpful for preparing answers to behavioral questions ("tell me about a time a project ran long" etc.).
* **System Design** --- this is a big one the more senior you get. You should be able to talk in broad strokes about how you'd design various systems, and be familiar (at least in passing) with database operations, caching, load balancing, etc. Some good resources:
	* [Awesome System Design](https://github.com/madd86/awesome-system-design)
	* [System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer)
	* [System Design for Interviews](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/systems-design-for-interviews/)
	* [Grokking the System Design Interview](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview)
    * Any number of system design/tech podcasts (I particularly liked using podcasts because it was interview prep I could do while out on a walk, instead of being glued to my computer)
* **Coding & Algorithms** --- I was pleasantly surprised that few of my companies asked me algorithm-heavy "invert this binary tree"-type problems, but it's good to be prepared. Probably more than algorithms in particular though, for senior roles you should focus on being able to code cleanly, narrating your thought process as you go, and being able to talk about the time and space complexity of your solution. Additional things that will help you in coding interviews: liberal use of TODOs so you don't bog yourself down (e.g. "there's probably an edge case here, but let me finish the rest of the function and I'll come back to it"), and willingness to ask questions/use Google/admit when you don't know stuff ("ugh, is the function `.sort()` or `.sorted()`? Well, that's the sort of thing I'd Google, let's assume it's `.sort()` for now...").

    * [Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/index.html)
    * [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)
    * [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard)
    * Any ["Advent of Code"](https://adventofcode.com/) problems
* **Behavioral Questions (aka "Soft Skills")** --- don't neglect this prep! Take the time to outline answers to the common behavioral questions ("tell me about a conflict you had with a coworker" etc.) and practice talking through them, so you have examples at your fingertips. In particular, it's useful to workshop these answers with a friend/collegue/mentor so that you can cast difficult situations in the best light, make sure you're being honest without being overly critical, etc.

#### Practice Interviews!
Above are some resources that you can use for self-study, but IMHO, by far the best way to prep for interviews is to do practice interviews! Reach out to your tech communities, old coworkers, friends in the industry, etc.---more than likely, there will be people willing to give you mock interviews in any of the above. In general, everyone in tech has had someone help them out in this capacity, so most of us are paying it forward and happy to help others!


### Company funnel and scheduling interviews
The first thing to do is pick the companies you'll be applying to. If you need ideas, start by looking at places your friends are happy, products that you use and are excited about, or teams with missions that fire you up. Check reviews on Glassdoor. Don't be afraid to hit up friends and LinkedIn connections for backchannel about a company. Get as much information as you can in the preliminary fact-finding stage so that you have an idea of whether the company will be a good fit.

Do your best to keep all of your interview processes in sync with each other: first all the preliminary recruiter chats, and when you've finished those, *then* all the tech screens, and *then* the onsites, etc. (If you *can* take a whole week off of work to knock out all of your onsites, I highly recommend it! Remember, you want to take not only enough time to do the interviews, but also enough time to rest between them.)

Be up front about your timeline from the very beginning, and repeat it every chance you get. Setting expectations for "I hope to do all my onsites the week of X and make a decision by Y" will help your interview coordinators help you, and make it easier for you to keep all your interview processes in sync with each other. (Likewise, if you have a specific timeline for *starting* your new position, repeat that early and often so it doesn't get lost in the shuffle.)

If you can afford to be picky with your companies, be picky! Narrow your options and don't try to play the field---move forward with at most 3 companies you're excited about. (I did 5, that was doable but also pretty stressful). Don’t be afraid to bow out of the process early with a given company if you're not excited about them. You can also always put companies on hold, and come back to them if none of your first choice companies work out.

### In the interview
There's plenty of tech interview advice out there that's way better than what I can give, but I _will_ say: in your interview, don't shit on your current job. If you have big frustrations, get them out of your system with a friend, and then workshop diplomatic answers to standard interview questions about why you’re leaving, a time you had a conflict with a coworker, etc. (Also, remember that when negotiation time rolls around, “I could always just stay at my current job”is a very powerful bargaining chip. Don’t take that away from yourself even if you have no intention of staying at your current job.)
