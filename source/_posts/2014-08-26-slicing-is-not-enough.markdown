The sudoku solver that I'm working on with [Miriam](https://mlauter.github.io/) was nearly finished before it started when we were playing around with ways to draw a board to terminal. I came to the table with some initial code I had written--

    def draw_board(board):
        for i in range(0,9):
            board[i].insert(6, "|")
            board[i].insert(3, "|")
            row_string = "  ".join(map(str, board[i]))
            if i in [2, 5]:
                print row_string
                print "________________________________"
            else:
                print row_string

    def newboard():
        return [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
            [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
            [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
            [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
            [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
            [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
            [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
            [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
            [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]

and the shiny output!

    >>> myboard = newboard()
    >>> draw_board(myboard)

    0  0  0  |  0  0  0  |  0  0  0
    0  0  0  |  0  0  0  |  0  0  0
    0  0  0  |  0  0  0  |  0  0  0

    0  0  0  |  0  0  0  |  0  0  0

Everything was awesome! Or so I thought. But look what happened when I ran the code again.

    >>> draw_board(myboard)

    0  0  0  |  |  0  0  |  0  |  0  0  0
    0  0  0  |  |  0  0  |  0  |  0  0  0
    0  0  0  |  |  0  0  |  0  |  0  0  0

    0  0  0  |  |  0  0  |  0  |  0  0  0
    ________________________________
    0  0  0  |  |  0  0  |  0  |  0  0  0

    0  0  0  |  |  0  0  |  0  |  0  0  0

And again.

    >>> draw_board(myboard)

    0  0  0  |  |  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  0  0
    0  0  0  |  |  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  0  0
    0  0  0  |  |  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  0  0

    0  0  0  |  |  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  0  0

    0  0  0  |  |  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  0  0

AAAAAHHHH!!! THE VERTICAL LINES ARE ATTACKING! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!

At this point, being a clever programmer, I realized that I was changing the myboard array every time, inserting more and more vertical lines every time at indeces 3 and 6 every time I called `draw_board`.

    >>> myboard
    [[0, 0, 0, '|', '|', '|', 0, '|', 0, '|', 0, '|', 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, '|', '|',
    '|', 0, '|', 0, '|', 0, '|', 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, '|', '|', '|', 0, '|', 0, '|',
    0, '|', 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, '|', '|', '|', 0, '|', 0, '|', 0, '|', 0, 0, 0], [0,
     0, 0, '|', '|', '|', 0, '|', 0, '|', 0, '|', 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, '|', '|', '|',
     0, '|', 0, '|', 0, '|', 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, '|', '|', '|', 0, '|', 0, '|', 0, '
    |', 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, '|', '|', '|', 0, '|', 0, '|', 0, '|', 0, 0, 0], [0, 0,
    0, '|', '|', '|', 0, '|', 0, '|', 0, '|', 0, 0, 0]]

    So I handily revised my code:

    def draw_board(board):
        copyboard = board[:]
        for i in range(0,9):
            copyboard[i].insert(6, "|")
            copyboard[i].insert(3, "|")
            row_string = "  ".join(map(str, copyboard[i]))
            if i in [2, 5]:
                print row_string
                print "________________________________"
            else:
                print row_string

Instead of modifying `board`, I was modifying `copyboard`, a _new_ object made by slicing `board`. Since it wasn't point back to the original array passed into the function, I reasoned, the original array wouldn't be modified, and I could continue calling `draw_board(myboard)` to my heart's content.

But, horror of horrors! The vertical lines kept attacking! I thought I knew how slicing worked! At this point I brought to code to Miriam, stumped. We did a sanity check:

    >>> a = [1,2,3]
    >>> b = a
    >>> b
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> a is b
    True
    >>> c = a[:]
    >>> c
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> a is c
    False
    >>> a.append(4)
    >>> a
    [1, 2, 3, 4]
    >>> b
    [1, 2, 3, 4]
    >>> c
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>>

If you point a new object back to an existing object, then they're identical and the new object always refers back to the old one, _but_ you can create a new list (via slicing) that is identical to the old list but doesn't refer back to it, has a separate identity, can be called and modified separately, etc. What was going onnn???

The problem, we eventually discovered, was with nested lists. Turns out that slicing is not enough: you get a _new_ list of lists, but all the lists inside point back to the old lists.

    >>> a = [[1,2,3],[1,2,3],[1,2,3]]
    >>> c = a[:]
    >>> a
    [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]
    >>> c
    [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]
    >>> a is c
    False
    >>> a[0] is c[0]
    True

So even though we copied the board with slicing--`copyboard = board[:]`--all of the rows in `copyboard` still pointed at the rows in `board`: copyboard[i]` and `board[i] were the same thing, so modifying `copyboard` changed `board` as well, leading to the endless insertion of vertical lines observed above.

Miriam hit upon this really excellent thing called _deep copy_; as opposed to regular 'ol shallow copying like that above, deep copy would make a _new list_ populated by _new lists_. And hallelujah, the problem was solved! The vertical line monsters were vanquished, and the people of Sudoku-Land could live in peace once more!

    import copy

    def draw_board(board):
        copyboard = copy.deepcopy(board)
        for i in range(0,9):
            copyboard[i].insert(6, "|")
            ...etc.
