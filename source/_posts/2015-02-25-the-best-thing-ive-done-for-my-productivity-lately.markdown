But seriously. The best thing I've done for my productivity lately (besides blocking Facebook entirely on my work machine) is [disabling my Facebook newsfeed](//chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kill-news-feed/hjobfcedfgohjkaieocljfcppjbkglfd) (this is a Chrome extension, I'm sure there are various others for other browsers). Facebook is still a time-suck, but not the ENDLESS VORTEX OF DISTRACTION AND OOH A BUZZFEED ARTICLE that it once was. Pretty cool stuff!
