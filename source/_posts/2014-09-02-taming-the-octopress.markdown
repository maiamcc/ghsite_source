I was messing around with my website yesterday, and trying to make two sub-websites for my 'Music' and 'Programming' hats in a single Octopress install, and I _really was going to be on time to my dinner plans_ except once my website experiment was borked and I tried to restore my previous site... well, long story short, it was the borked-est, and I spent an hour then and an hour today hunting around with [Allison](http://akaptur.github.io/) trying to fix the problem. Turns out that in trying to roll back my changes, I'd introduced some discrepancy between my `master` and `gh-pages` branches, and I could get around all of this on github with force pushes (`-f`), but not so easily with actually deploying my site (`rake deploy`). In the end, I had to go into my Rakefile and add a plus sign somewhere that tells Octopress not to worry whether it's doing fast-forward commits[1] and just commit anyway.

So, my website is alive, I have lost hours of my life to the jaws of the Octopress, and I may be switching to Jekyll or Pelican soon. But in the meantime, all of this made me intensely curious about git! I hit up [Mary](http://maryrosecook.com/) for a mini-seminar, and I will now write it all out on my blog to make sure I understood it. Feel free to read along, learn from my simplistic explanation, correct my gross misunderstandings, etc.! So now, on to our feature presentation:

## All About Git!
### The Bestest SCM with the Worstest UI

#### All of your Git-age lives in the .git folder
When you run `git init`, all it does is create a `.git` folder. That's it! Your machine knows what folders are and aren't by the presence or absence of a `.git` directory. `.git` is a hidden folder, so to see it, type `ls -a`. Whenever you add or commit things to your git repo, they'll get stored in here.

I'm now in the directory of my new project, `gittest`. It contains two files, `a` and `b`, and isn't yet a git repo. When I look at what's inside it, it looks like this:

    maia$ ls -a
    .   ..  a   b

Let's make it a git repo:

    maia$ git init
    Initialized empty Git repository in [stuff]/gittest/.git/
    maia$ ls -a
    .   ..  .git    a   b

We can see the `.git` folder! Success! Here's the stuff inside it:

    maia$ ls -a
    .       HEAD        description info        refs
    ..      config      hooks       objects

#### Anatomy of a commit: blobs, trees, commits
The git magic happens largely in the `/objects` folder. Right now it's got two folders in it that we don't care about, `info` and `pack`, which have to do with misc. git magic. But this is where stuff goes when we add/commit it. So let's do that.

    maia$ git add -A
    maia$ ls .git/objects/
    31  e9  info    pack

31 and e9 are both folders, and each has only one object in it, files with big long gibberish names: `31/e9dce72edaeb87f2b007b09230bfd5008da63e` and `e9/1ace6ef46e2244fc3588bdead8f66b35b20d12`. They contain gibberish, which is fancy git compression/encoding of the contents of file a and b. The folder name and file name, taken together, make a big long hash that you can use to recover the original file contents[2] (`xx/yyyyyy` --> the hash `xxyyyyyy`):

    maia$ glook e91ace6ef46e2244fc3588bdead8f66b35b20d12
    stuff inside file a

These big long hashes point to files, known in git-land as `blobs`. Right now these are staged. After we commit them, `.git/objects` looks like this:

    maia$ ls .git/objects/
    31  81  a7  e9  info    pack

We have two new directories in here since our commit, both in the same `xx/yyyyyy` format where `xxyyyyyy` is a big long hash thing we can use to access the thing inside. Here's the stuff inside the two new things:

    maia$ glook 81ad97f6d112d96081fffc3d3b729828917eff5e
    tree a720b6d097b88601c3647be863269539ccc7f64d
    author maianess <maia.mcc@gmail.com> 1409698376 -0400
    committer maianess <maia.mcc@gmail.com> 1409698376 -0400

    first commit
    maia$ glook a720b6d097b88601c3647be863269539ccc7f64d
    100644 blob e91ace6ef46e2244fc3588bdead8f66b35b20d12    a
    100644 blob 31e9dce72edaeb87f2b007b09230bfd5008da63e    b

The first thing is a `commit` object. It lists a `tree` object, author, committer, and commit message (which here is "first commit"). The second thing is a `tree` object: it contains references to all files or folders (which would also be tree objects) in the given commit. This tree points to our files a and b (identified by their magic git hashes).

OH, but also, from the second commit onward, commit objects look a little different. They have one additional line that provides the hash of the parent, or the commit directly before that one. I added a file `c` in directory `foo`. Here's what my second commit looks like:

    maia$ glook 33380bb5dfd152bf72dad49c3e388bccee1a4dfb
    tree 0d656c0ff73ea5315ec498acf144df9958e48819
    parent 81ad97f6d112d96081fffc3d3b729828917eff5e
    author maianess <maia.mcc@gmail.com> 1409709920 -0400
    committer maianess <maia.mcc@gmail.com> 1409709920 -0400

    second: added directory 'foo'

To sumarize, the three kinds of objects you'll find in `.git/objects` look like this.

#####Blob, aka file:
_[encoded contents of the file]_

#####Commit:
_tree: [hash of tree pointing to the files of this commit]<br>
author: [name]<br>
[commit message]_

#####Tree:
_[hash of a blog (file)]<br>
[hash of a blog (file)]<br>
[hash of a blog (file)]<br>
...as many times as you want<br>
[hash of a tree (folder)]<br>
[hash of a tree (folder)]<br>
...as many times as you want_

####How a few commits might look
Git objects contain the hashes of other git objects, which is how the files keep track of each other. Given a commit, you can find the tree representing the root, and from there all of the files and/or folders (represented by trees) that it contains. From that same commit, you can also find it's parent commit, and then _its_ parent, each with their attendant file-states, and so can trace your history back. Let's look at fun diagrams!

Here's my initial commit, when the file tree looks like this, and my git looks like this:

    .
    ├── a
    ├── b

![Git diagram](/images/git1.png)

Now let's say I add a directory `foo`, and a file in foo `c`, and make changes to `a` and `b`. The file tree now looks like this, and my git looks like this:

    .
    ├── a
    ├── b
    └── foo
        └── c

![Git guts](/images/git2.png)

You see that the main tree, `tree2`, is pointing directly to `a` and `b` but not to `c`--rather, it points to `tree2.1`, which points to `c`. It looks this way because git uses trees to represent directories; it references files living in subdirectories via trees (representing those directories) referencing those files.

Note that git is still storing (in super-compact encoded form) all previous versions of the files, and given this network of things-that-contain-hashes-of-other-things, we know exactly where to look for any version of any file we want to find. And git only makes the necessary changes. Look what happens if we change `a` and `c` but leave `b` the same:

![Git guts](/images/git3.png)

There's no need to make another representation of `b`, since `b` hasn't been changed this commit. Instead, where the tree has to point to `b`, it points to the hash of the _existing_ version of `b`.

So, now I understand a biiiiit more about the whacky world of git and just what these cryptic commands are doing! I even understand pointers and branching and detached head state and all that a bit better, but that is perhaps another post for another day. Cheers!

[1] To quote from the Git docs: "When you try to merge one commit with a commit that can be reached by following the first commit’s history, Git simplifies things by moving the pointer forward because there is no divergent work to merge together — this is called a 'fast forward'." Or, look at this [explanation in pretty pictures](https://sandofsky.com/images/fast_forward.pdf). By default, Octopress will only deploy (which includes a commit) on a fast-forward, to avoid accidentally messing up any intermediate branched stuff.

[2] `glook` is a shortcut I made; the full command to get file contents from one of these hashes is `git cat-file -p`.
