Hello all, and welcome to Maia's journey through Hacker School, as chronicled on a blog that probably only she herself will actually read. Here's where I'll keep track of projects, goals, progress, thoughts and feelings, etc. This morning was spent getting oriented and configuring my machine. Then eating lunch. Now I'm gonna go learn how to git.

**Language:** Python

**Current Project:** Work my way through [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/). (Oberservation: this guy is kind of a jerkhead.)

**Future Project Possibilities:**

*   Chorale harmonizer
*   Ear training chorale error game
*   Contradance datebase/contra card program
*   Random contra generator
*   iTunes composer homogonizer (because my iTunes categorization is a mess)
*   Facebook/net distraction time limit
*   Tic-tac-toe?
*   Hero name gen., tavern name gen., NPC trait gen., etc.
*   "Are you being productive??" app (possibly will post your failures to Zulip)
*   Keychain-like password/password hint storage

**Misc. Maintenance Stuff:**

-   SSH git (so I don't need to put my password in every time)
-   Pretty way to view git log
-   fix $PATH later so it's not redundant
-   iterm pretty colors
-   (Gravity online correctly, with mute button etc) **DONE**
-   Make my real website, or at least put this blog on my domain name
-   Streamline Octopress blogging (including fixing whatever means that I need to put quotes around *rake "new_post[postname]"*)
-   Clean up my github day notes

**Other Stuff to Learn:**

-   How to git properly
-   How to terminal properly

**Where I'll Pick Up Tomorrow:** [Lesson 8](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex8.html)
