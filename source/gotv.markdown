Numbers are in, and y'all really came through! With these numbers, plus 340 doors knocked on (from a distance) at 75¢ ea., that's over $2,800 dollars! So, I'm donating my max of $1,000.

There's a lot of work still to be done, and I appreciate everything y'all have done and will do--thanks for helping make this country a better place. ❤️

* For more on how to think about political volunteering and how to get started, [this is a great resource](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XgjCe5YXxv9aI4Jk78YvqYN9Sa5o5M-vWpx5NKz3MDY/edit).

There are a LOT of ways to get involved, and it can feel overwhelming, but honestly, just pick one at random and you'll be making a difference! <3 Even just an hour a week is real and important work.

Rather than reinventing the wheel, I'm linking to some very smart folks' guide on this subject: see the above guides for ways to get involved: donate, call, text, write, volunteer, whatever you can manage!
