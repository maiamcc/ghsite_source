## For every call/text/postcard for blue candidates between now and Election Day (Tues. 11/3), I'll donate to the [ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/) (to a max of $500)!

Don't know where to start? [See below](#resources) for links and orgs.

* [**No Regrets 2020**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DxPiSZ82AZoyHeICMP6tVVfJ2ItbKA0evpdkR7l7FiE/edit) (big list of ways to get involved)
* For more on how to think about political volunteering and how to get started, [this is a great resource](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XgjCe5YXxv9aI4Jk78YvqYN9Sa5o5M-vWpx5NKz3MDY/edit).

There are a LOT of ways to get involved, and it can feel overwhelming, but honestly, just pick one at random and you'll be making a difference! <3 Even just an hour a week is real and important work.

Rather than reinventing the wheel, I'm linking to some very smart folks' guide on this subject: see the above guides for ways to get involved: donate, call, text, write, volunteer, whatever you can manage!
