I am a contradance caller and dance writer based in New York City. I call both contra evenings and family dances, full programs and guest spots. Additionally, I have experience as a dance organizer, having run the monthly Williams College dance for three years. (I've also been organizing the NYC Contra Flash Mob for the past two summers--the first was at [Grand Central](//www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEY5rTqO62Y), the second at [Union Square](//www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUGyxwBVCTc).) In addition to calling and dancing wherever I can, I also write dances, and have been dabbling in writing contra tunes.

Look at some [dances I've written](/contra/dances.html) or [tunes I've written](/contra/tunes.html), or read on for media samples and my <a href="#callhist">calling history</a>.
