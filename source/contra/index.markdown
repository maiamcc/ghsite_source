I am a contradance caller and dance writer based in New York City. I call both contra evenings and family dances, full programs and guest spots. Additionally, I have experience as a dance organizer, having run the monthly Williams College dance for three years (and having organized the NYC Contra Flash Mob for the past two summers! Here's a video of the [First Annual NYC Contra Flash Mob, in Grand Central](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEY5rTqO62Y)). In addition to calling and dancing wherever I can, I also write dances, and have been dabbling in writing contra tunes.

Look at some [dances I've written](/contra/dances.html) or [tunes I've written](/contra/tunes.html), or read on for more about my experience as a dance caller.
