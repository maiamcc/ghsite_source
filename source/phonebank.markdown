## For every phonebanking call y'all make for blue candidates between now and Election Day (Tues. 11/6), I'll donate 50Â¢ to the [Transgender Law Center](https://transgenderlawcenter.org/) (to a max of $500).

[**Report your calls here**](https://goo.gl/forms/9QxgPagOmaXLIo5X2), and let's go save the world!

### How do I phonebank?
[SwingLeft recommends a couple of key races to call for](https://swingleft.org/p/call-voters). If you want to do your own homework, find a tight race (check out [FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-midterm-election-forecast/house/)) and Google "[candidate's name] online phonebank" or click around the candidate's homepage for a "Get Involved" or similar.

You can phonebank with friends or alone, from home or as part of an event. You'll be calling registered Democrats, so don't worry, you won't need to argue or change anyone's mind, just encourage them to actually get out and vote.

Every phonebanking campaign worth their salt gives you a script/talking points, so you don't have to do your own research -- all the info is right there. Even your wrong numbers make a difference -- they help on-the-ground canvassers be more efficient by skipping non-voter households.

Best of all: it's something you can do for 20 minutes and still have an impact. So hey: do the thing!

### Why now?
The more Democrats we can get into the House and Senate, the better our changes of NOT descending into a fascist hellscape. The more Democratic governers we vote in, the better we can fight voter suppression in the 2020 elections. And well, the inverse is unfortunately true as well.

So if you've been reluctant to get involved in politics, feel like it's not the right time, etc.: **this is the time!** We've got less than a week till Midterms, but never fear: there's still stuff you can do to make a difference!

Midterm elections tend to have a low voter turnout: of the voting eligible population, only about 40% votes during midterm elections (compared to about 60% in presidential election years). [^1] That's a lot of untapped voters, which is why encouraging people to _actually go vote_ is such a needle-mover. It's also the case that "the party of the incumbent president tends to lose ground during midterm elections" [^2] -- so anyone we get out to the polls, regardless of party, is statistically more likely to support blue candidates than red ones.
