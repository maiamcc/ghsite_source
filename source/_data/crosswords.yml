  notes: Maybe my first halfway-decent puzzle? Those who know me will not be surprised by this theme in the slightest. Apologies.

  notes: My very first completed crossword, and a very niche one at that. <strong>Should only be attempted by contradancers</strong>. Created with <a href="http://www.keiranking.com/phil/" target="_blank">Phil</a>, a free crossword creator by Keiran King. There are lots of things I'd do differently now, but hey, it's my first puzzle!
