  <div class="entry-content"><p>(If you&rsquo;re confused, see <a href="/blog/2014/10/23/markov-madness/">my previous post on my Markov generator adventures</a>.)</p>

<p>The other thing I got up to today was implementing some sort of (questionable) part-of-speech-based intelligence. The idea was to have a dictionary for parts of speech, in addition to a dictionary of words. Then the work flow would go something like this:</p>

<p>1) start with a random seed
2) what part of speech should come next? Given the POS&rsquo;s we already have, pick at random one that might follow it.
3) given the words we have, pick a word that might follow <em>of the correct part of speech</em>. If none exists, repeat from step 2.</p>

<p>Now, using word trigrams and POS trigrams, the above process doesn&rsquo;t really add much beyond what using plain &lsquo;ol word trigrams gets you. Could I make something better, though, by using, say, 4-grams or 5-grams of parts of speech?</p>

<p>Well&hellip; I&rsquo;ll leave that to you to decide. Here are a bunch of different sample texts from Pride and Prejudice. All are word-gram-3. Some have no POS support, some are POS-gram-3, and some are POS-gram-4. (POS-gram-5, incedentally, doesn&rsquo;t really work&ndash;the requirements on what word you need to come next get so specific that there generally isn&rsquo;t one and the program crashes.) Which of these seem the most sensical? Can you guess which are no-POS, POS-gram-3, and POS-gram-4? Make your guesses&ndash;and then, if you want to check yourself, look at the HTML source for answers.</p>

<pre><code>1) 'into a marriage with Miss Bennet. Miss Bingley\'s pretended regard." "Would you believe it, Lizzy, that is the most uncomfortable in her favour. Bingley was then disclosed in the same house with the length of his going away when I tell you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to Mr. Darcy:--but let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I were agreeing that we should all be there by Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley in a prudential light it places Mr. Darcy, by the awkwardness of the letter nor its writer were at the gate in the discharge of his'&lt;!--POS-gram = 4--&gt;

2) 'difference of situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins\'s picture of a sort of man; and of late it has not time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her so expressively, and shook hands with great enjoyment; and the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious and uneasy, the period to which you have pleasure," said Bingley; "and I am in earnest. I speak plainer? Do not wish me such an assurance of it, that the match with a bow of superior society; but I know very well able to do it, she turned suddenly towards him and Mr. Darcy, "There'&lt;!--POS-gram = 3--&gt;

3) 'from my thoughts." "When they all are." "All young ladies were ready enough to determine her feelings in the time. Good gracious! when I have always seen a great deal more than I might have sufficient charms; and though the probability of error, and seek to recommend them," replied he; "they are married!" Elizabeth read on: "I have no wish of seeing him almost for the felicity which a pair of fine eyes in amazement, but was too happy, however, and if he sees enough of Bingley\'s being withheld from seeing Jane, she seriously hoped he might change his mind' &lt;!--no POS support--&gt;

4) 'ever have courage to shew Mrs. Gardiner\'s former residence, and where she had listened to her eyes, envied everyone to whom they would have been impossible for us to Miss Darcy, who had only set that down as soon as they used to be privileged to whisper to Elizabeth, "I hope not so. Painful recollections will not have forgotten where she was ready enough to make her resigned. As for my impertinence?" "For the liveliness of your own. But we are better acquainted--" He was resolutely silent, however, and, from a circulating library), he started back, and begging pardon, protested' &lt;!--no POS support--&gt;

5) 'months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Bingley. It was at length return home; and she was to bring it in my own doing, and I thought only of the peace of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how violent was Mr. Bingley\'s chaise to go with him; and unwilling, for her sister\'s sake, to provoke him.

6) 'Darcy\'s praise occupied the chief of it. Can I speak plainer? Do not let your fancy run away with you. You will be an object of it, but Colonel Fitzwilliam was no more than she knew it myself, as it had not yet been able to enter the ----shire. She had no other reply to this effect: "I have been to persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at any time, etc. etc.; and if not, it would be gone in five minutes, you meant it to another, not to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the'&lt;!--POS-gram = 3--&gt;

<h3>Part 1: Setting up the environment</h3>

<p>Setting up your environment is <em>awful</em>. You think, &ldquo;how long can it take to set up a virtuam machine and install this software?&rdquo; The answer? <em>Longer than you could ever imagine.</em> Especially if your project is on a platform you&rsquo;re not familiar with, ask for advice early and often&ndash;because inevitably, something will go wrong and you&rsquo;ll need to ask someone wiser for help anyway, and you might as well not a bunch of junk to undo by the time you do. (Like when I tried to install VirtualBox Guest Additions and it destroyed by VM&rsquo;s video driver, and in fact all video drivers on any VMs I later installed. I had to wipe VirtualBox and start over. No fun.)</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I spent a ton of my time at Hacker School learning how to ask questions (or, to put a finer point on it, learning how to <em>not know things</em> and admit to others that I don&rsquo;t know things). The main reason that HS was so hard at first was that I wasn&rsquo;t good at asking qusetions, at admitting when I didn&rsquo;t know things, at letting myself (I feared) appear &ldquo;stupid&rdquo; in front of others. I was still better than some folks at pushing through this, but I wasn&rsquo;t as good as I would have liked. (This is all tied into impostor syndrome, of course.)</p>

<p>I got vastly better at this skill as I spent more time at Hacker School. I grew more comfortable in the environment, I gained trust in the folks around me and in my own abilities, and I came to believe that my asking questions, even ones about really basic (quote-unquote-&ldquo;basic&rdquo;) things, was a display of intelligence rather than a display of ignorance.</p>

<p>What I didn&rsquo;t realize about my shiny new skill of &ldquo;Admitting When I Don&rsquo;t Know Something and Asking Questions&rdquo; was how context-dependent it is. At Hacker School, in person or on Zulip, I feel totally comfortable asking questions about &ldquo;simple&rdquo; things, and admitting that I&rsquo;m totally in over my head with, say, troubleshooting my Virtual Machine installation and would someone please help me, and what is actually the difference between GET and POST because I never really learned it&hellip; that sort of thing. But as I prepare my application for the coming round of <a href="https://opw.gnome.org">OPW</a> and dive head-first into IRC chats about programs and programming styles I&rsquo;ve never used before, that all seem to require strange dependencies or have to be run on X virtual machine with Y stuff built on it, I recognize a feeling from my early days of Hacker School.</div>

<p>Here I am, first Monday without returning to Hacker School, sitting down to say &ldquo;Okay world, I spent the last three months <em>writing code</em> and it was awesome but I should know something about theory, algorithms, etc.; time to do some studying.&rdquo; I intended to sit down with <a href="http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html">Interactive Python</a> and blaze through a section or two before turning away to work on my other projects, job applications, etc.</p>

<p>INSTEAD, I was filled with a sudden anxiety&ndash;what if Interactive Python isn&rsquo;t the right course for me? What if it&rsquo;s an okay course but there are better ones out there? What if by doing Interactive Python I&rsquo;m missing <em>the perfect algos course for me and this perfect course and I will be like ships passing in the night, never knowing what we might have had together, and all because I chose to work on Interactive Python</em>.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today on &ldquo;Bugs that everyone already knew about but Maia found out about for the first time so will write up anyway&rdquo;, we&rsquo;re going to talk about the perils and pitfalls of using mutable objects as default arguments for functions in Python. (This episode brought to you by Maia&rsquo;s contradance database and the letter Y.)</p>

<p>No, nothing went wrong in my code that caused me to learn this lesson, but multiple code reivewers raised red flags about this line in my code: <code>def resolve_query_dict(d, moves_list=Move.objects.all())</code>. <code>Move.objects.all()</code>, by the way, is a fancy Django function that returns a list of all of the <code>Move</code> objects in your database, and since I would likely never be running this code over an extended period of time while things were added to the database, accidentally freezing the value of &ldquo;all of the moves in my database&rdquo; wouldn&rsquo;t have really been an issue, but the dangers of writing code like the above are still whacky and interesting. Basically, odd things happen when you use mutable objects or called functions as default variables in your functions.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Apparently some people at Hacker School think I&rsquo;m an Iron Blogger, despite me being nothing of the sort. There&rsquo;s no money riding on whether or not I make consistent blog posts&ndash;but I figure I should do what I can to sustain this favorable impression of me!)</p>

<p>Since my HS halfway check-in, I&rsquo;ve resolved to ask more questions and not let myself get stuck banging my head against problems that could be solved in a hot second by any of the three people sitting next to me. I think that I&rsquo;ve done a pretty good job with this resolution; I ask for help way more frequently, and as a result, I think I get more done. However, I feel the need to remind myself that there is such a thing as <em>asking for too much help</em>.</p>

<p>Take this example: I was sitting down with Tristan, a fellow HSer, attempting to set up virtualenv and get all of my permissions and installs un-borked. I was totally in over my head, having never used virtualenv before, and he was helping me sort it out. There was some funky stuff that needed fixing having to do with my $PATH being invalid because one of the folder names contained a space. We dealt with that issue, and now most of the stuff worked, but I still couldn&rsquo;t manage to run bpython from inside my virtualenv. I showed Tristan the error message my computer was spewing, and asked him, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His response: &ldquo;What do you think is going on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Me: &ldquo;Well, it won&rsquo;t run bpython!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Him: &ldquo;Come on, you can do better than that.&rdquo;</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here are some gleanings from Amy&rsquo;s code review of <a href="https://github.com/maiamcc/phonebook">my phonebook applet</a>, and some self-study. Mostly for my own records and so I actually absorb all of this by writing out, but if anyone has comments, additions, disagreements with anything I&rsquo;ve written here, fire away!</p>

<ul>
<li>misc. layout stuff, like putting import statements in alphabetical order</li>
<li>avoid global vars when possible. I already knew this, but it&rsquo;s good to remember. For example, if you&rsquo;ve assuming your program will be run on the command line, you can put global vars in the <code>main()</code> function.</li>
<li>functions that only incedentally return stuff are <em>bad news</em>. I had a function called <code>phonebook_exists</code> that checked to see if the phonebook you were trying to look up existed; if it didn&rsquo;t exist, the func. would throw an error, and if it did, it would return the data of the phonebook. Which in retrospect was super weird because nothing the function name indicated that it was what you should use to get the contents of a saved phonebook. A much more sensible way to do this is to have a function called <code>read_phonebook</code> which attempts to return the contents of the saved phonebook, but if it fails (which you figure out with a try/except), then it throws an error. (Incidentally, I had a similar confusion with when things should and shouldn&rsquo;t be returned in another project I&rsquo;m working on, my bootleg homemade git. I had a function called <code>save_at_hash</code> that would hash a file, save it at its hash, and then return the hash. Why did this function return the hash? I assumed it would be useful. Couldn&rsquo;t really tell you why. I ended up refactoring it into two functions, <code>make_hash</code>&ndash;which took a file and returned a hash&ndash;and <code>save_at_hash</code>&ndash;which took a file and a hash and saved a copy of the file at that hash.)</div>
