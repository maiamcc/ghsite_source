<p>Maia first started programming in an Intro CS class her senior year at Williams College, and got really excited about programming later that year, when she participated in the Williams College Game Jam (for which she made [Gravity](/projects/gravity/play.html). After graduating from Williams in 2014 with a B.A. in music, she went to [Hacker School](https://www.hackerschool.com/) in NYC, a 3-month self-directed programmersâ€™ retreat. There she taught herself Python and hacked on various things, including an [imitation git](https://github.com/maiamcc/goob), a(n abandoned) [part-of-speech-based Markov generator](https://github.com/maiamcc/markovgen), a [Django database of dance choreographies](https://github.com/maiamcc/contradb), and a [pun bot for the chat client Zulip](https://github.com/maiamcc/punbot).</p>

<p>Now done with Hacker School, Maia is excited to explore the wide world of programming. Her strongest language is Python, and she has experience with Django, Javascript/JQuery, and HTML/CSS. She is particularly interested in music, feminism/activism/social justice, education, and good food, but is generally psyched to get her hands dirty with interesting problems.</p>

<p>When not programming, Maia can usually be found singing, conducting, composing, dancing, cooking, or eating. She was born and raised in Manhattan, where she is currently based.</p>
